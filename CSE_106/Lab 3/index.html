    <p>This is the home page and on the other pages is where you will 
      find information regarding some popular breeds of Cats. The reason that I chose to write about cats is becuase 
      I put in the video first and was like well might as well make it about cats at this point. 
      Also I like the movie Puss in Boots the last wish, which is why he is on the home screen.</p>
