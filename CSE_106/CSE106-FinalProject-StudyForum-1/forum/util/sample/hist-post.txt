What were some of the key events and turning points that led to the outbreak of
World War I, and how did this conflict shape the course of the 20th century?

World War I was a major conflict that involved many of the world's great powers
and lasted from 1914 to 1918. Although the causes of the war are complex and
multifaceted, there were several key events and turning points that set the
stage for this global conflict.

The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian
nationalist in June 1914 was the event that ultimately triggered the war.
Austria-Hungary, backed by Germany, declared war on Serbia, and this set off a
chain reaction of alliances and declarations of war that quickly spread the
conflict across Europe.

One of the most significant causes of World War I was the system of alliances
that had developed between the various European powers. These alliances were
designed to provide mutual protection and security, but they also created a
complex web of relationships that made it difficult to contain any local
conflict.

World War I had a profound impact on the course of the 20th century. It led to
the collapse of several major empires, including the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman,
and Russian empires, and it set the stage for the rise of new global powers such
as the United States and the Soviet Union. The war also led to the development
of new technologies and military tactics, such as trench warfare and chemical
weapons, that would shape the nature of warfare for decades to come.
