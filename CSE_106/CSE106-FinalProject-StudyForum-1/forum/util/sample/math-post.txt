Find the derivative of f(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x - 7 using the power rule of differentiation.

To find the derivative of a polynomial using the power rule of
differentiation,we differentiate each term of the polynomial and apply the power
rule, sssssssssssswhich states that the derivative of x^n with respect to x is n*x^(n-1).

So, to find the derivative of f(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 3x - 7, we differentiate each term separately:

f'(x) = d/dx(2x^3) - d/dx(4x^2) + d/dx(3x) - d/dx(7)

Applying the power rule to each term gives:
